                <p>Hi, my name is Lisa Upperud. I am currently studying to become a Fullstack Java Developer at

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>At age 24 I discovered my interest for programming thorugh a C# course. I have always been a very
                    structured and organized person which translated well with programming and a new hobby was born.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always been very creative and found that programming was a great creative outlet for me. I
                    applied to STI in spring of 2024 and later enrolled in september that same year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I started my education I've started seeing the world through different eyes and constantly see
                    ways to improve the world around me, both for myself and society, which I think is the most existing
                    about codeing.

                <h3>Interest</h3>
                <p>I like to spend my free time with my family and friends. I prefer to have a structured day-to-day
                    life, so aside from studing and working part-time in the restaurant business I like to strength
                    train and cook.</p>
                <p>
                    A favorite interest of mine is reading, something I've been doing since I was 2 and a half years
                    old. I really enjoy
                    non-fiction books, mainly about neuro-science, health and biology. My favorite authors and educators
                    include Andrew Huberman, Anders Hansen and Robert Sapolsky. I find that learing about the human mind
                    and
                    body is crucial to our well-being as people and constatly learining about the science behind us
                    humans
                    help keep me motivated to life a healthy and productive life.
