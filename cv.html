                    After High School I still had some subjects to study which I did through Adult Education. This was
                    also
                    where I
                    had
                    my first interaction with code which sparked my interest for programming.

                    I am currently studying to become a Java Developer at STI, where I am gaining a solid foundation in

                    development with a focus on Java. The program includes both theory and hands-on projects, covering

                    programming,
                    object-oriented design, database management, and software development best practices.

                    I have gained practical
                    experience in backend and frontend development, using tools like Spring, SQL, Git, and Agile
                    methodologies. This
                    education is preparing me for the IT industry, equipping me with the problem-solving, teamwork, and

                <h3>Experience Description</h3>
                <p>
                    In the restaurant and bar industry, I have taken responsibility for tasks such as opening and
                    closing
                    procedures, ensuring that drinks, garnishes, napkins, and other supplies are well-stocked to
                    maintain
                    seamless
                    service.
                    Cleanliness and organization have always been priorities, ensuring a fresh and inviting environment
                    throughout
                    each shift. I have also contributed to creating seasonal drink menus, showcasing innovative
                    cocktails
                    that align
                    with the establishment's unique concept and atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant aspect of my role has been ensuring guests have a welcoming and enjoyable experience,
                    leaving
                    satisfied and eager to return. Interacting with new people daily has helped me develop strong
                    interpersonal
                    skills, enabling me to adapt to various personalities while balancing guest satisfaction with
                    company
                    standards
                    and policies. I enjoy tackling challenges and finding solutions to ensure a positive experience for
                    both
                    guests
                    and staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collaboration with team members across different roles—such as servers, bartenders, kitchen staff,
                    and
                    operations—has been vital to achieving shared goals. Working in this dynamic environment has
                    strengthened my
                    patience, stress management, and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential for delivering
                    exceptional
                    service in a fast-paced setting.
